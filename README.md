# Daily Coding Problem 2019-07-31

####  _Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today._

_This problem was asked by Facebook._

_A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different colors. He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color._

_Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to build the nth house with kth color, return the minimum cost which achieves this goal._
